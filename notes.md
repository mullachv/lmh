Hypothesis:
------
- all the word embeddings for questions, responses, reasoning, used/supported by an LLM fall
within a low dimensional manifold in a large high dimensional space. Perhaps as disconnected manifolds.
The manifolds for prompt questions, are different from prompt responses and similarly for prompt reasonings. 

Further we think it might that these manifolds are disconnected or exhibit holes within this high dimensional
space. And not just that even with the manifold for prompt (questions), there could exist gaps
based on topics, geographies, demographics etc. It is possible there may be a self-similar structure
within manifolds for a few layers.
